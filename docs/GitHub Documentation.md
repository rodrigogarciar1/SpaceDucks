## Project Overview

This project is focused on developing an intuitive application that simplifies the process of creating, visualizing, and managing linear regression models. It is designed to be user-friendly, enabling data analysts, business professionals, and IT team members to work seamlessly with data from various formats like CSV, Excel, and SQLite databases. The goal is to facilitate efficient data analysis and prediction making, even for those without advanced technical skills. The documentation will guide project members, developers, and technical writers through the features, setup, and use of the application.

## What is AI?

Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines. These systems are designed to learn, reason, and solve problems, allowing them to perform tasks that typically require human cognition, such as recognizing patterns, making predictions, or understanding language.

## What is Linear Regression?

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables within datasets. It helps predict outcomes by fitting a straight line or pattern to the data points, showing how changes in the independent variables are associated with changes in the dependent variable.

## Simple Example of Linear Regression

| Temperature (°C) | Coffee Sales (# of Cups) |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| 15                | 50                  |
| 20                | 60                  |
| 25                | 80                  |
| 30                | 100                 |
###### Table 1: Coffee Sales Based on Temperature ######

Let’s say you run a small coffee shop and want to predict your daily coffee sales based on the temperature outside. Collecting data on the temperature (independent variable) and corresponding coffee sales (dependent variable) over several days allows you to use linear regression to find a relationship between the two. For example, if you record data showing that more coffee is sold on warmer days, the application can calculate a line of best fit, such as Coffee Sales = 2 × Temperature + 20. This equation allows you to predict sales for any given temperature. If the temperature is 20°C, the expected sales would be 60 cups (2 × 20 + 20). Similarly, for 35°C, sales would be 90 cups (2 × 35 + 20). Linear regression simplifies understanding how one factor, such as temperature, influences another, like coffee sales, helping you make data-driven decisions to prepare for demand.




## How Does This Apply to This Project?

The application allows users to import data, select variables, and create regression models that can predict outcomes based on input data. By providing a graphical interface, the project makes it easier for users to build and interpret these models without needing to write code or have an in-depth understanding of statistical analysis. This ensures that the tool is accessible and useful for a range of users who may use or support the application.
