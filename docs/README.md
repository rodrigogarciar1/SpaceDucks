## 1. Introduction

This application streamlines the entire process of building, visualizing, and managing linear regression models, transforming what can often be a complex, technical task into a user-friendly experience. It is designed to accommodate data from multiple formats, such as CSV, Excel, and SQLite databases, making it simple and practical for diverse data analysis needs. By offering a friendly interface and straightforward workflows, the tool empowers data analysts and business professionals, regardless of their technical expertise to extract meaningful insights and make decisions efficiently. This accessibility ensures that even users without advanced programming skills can confidently use the power of regression analysis.

### 1.1 What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines. These systems are designed to learn, reason, and solve problems, allowing them to perform tasks that typically require human cognition, such as recognizing patterns, making predictions, or understanding language.


### 1.2 What is Linear Regression Model?

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables within datasets. It helps predict outcomes by fitting a straight line or pattern to the data points, showing how changes in the independent variables are associated with changes in the dependent variable.
